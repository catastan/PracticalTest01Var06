A small Android app simulating a simple **gambling-style dice game**:

- The **main screen** generates or randomizes three values, with optional locks.  
- It **navigates to a secondary activity** that evaluates the outcome and returns a score gain based on the combination.  
- A **background Service** runs and broadcasts a “victory” message when the accumulated score exceeds a certain threshold.
